      <h1>The making of</h1>

      <h2>Developing Alpha.gov.uk</h2>
      <p>
        From the start our focus was on creating the right tool (that is, the underlying code that we're building on top of) to serve each user need, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Our choice of language, framework, etc was primarily determined by how effectively it lets us build useful things. There was no preference for one over another.
      </p>
      <p>
        We supported that with a 'federated' architecture, where certain layers of responsibilities are spread out between a wide range of apps, that allows us to slot in different tools as we need them and then provide appropriate caching.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also gradually extracted services as we find we're re-using them. For example, our geo components are needed across several areas of the site so we bundled them up as a service that any individual tool can use. We could also then rely on these as we planned out further tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we have tried to observe best practices, our focus has firmly been on getting things out the door. We have kept notes of shortcuts that we’ve taken so we can go back and tidy up as time allows or as need requires. Some of this has happened in the later stages of the alpha and some would need further review before we considered taking any parts into beta development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been very conscious that this is an alpha; something that does the job, rather than architectural purity or super-scalability. There will be lots to review and revisit when we have real data about how the site is used and what the future of Alpha.gov.uk is.
      </p>

      <h2>Designing Alpha.gov.uk</h2>
      <p>
        The design aesthetic has been one that was focused on simplicity and modernity, using typography, photography and smooth shapes for its basis.
        Pages for citizens don't assume any hierarchies with tools separate from the departments that might ‘own’ them. We have worked hard to keep it simple and hide the complexity of government.
      </p>
      <p>
        We consider every visitor is a new user and that there should be no learning curve to the site, and no horizontal navigation. People tend to just arrive, perform task, and leave. The site itself is so broad that navigation just becomes cruft intervening between the user and their desired destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        For government departments we wanted a single Government brand that encompassed individual palettes but that felt consistent. It also needed to be distinct from citizen pages so that users understood that these were not tools but deeper levels of information relating to ministers and their work. These pages are designed for use by ministers and other professionals who must interact with Government on a departmental level, or for ministers to demonstrate their recent work on policy or consultations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agile development meant these designs were implemented and then iterated in conjunction with build work, making on-the-fly changes simpler. Feedback was sought during the design process from <a href="http://dribbble.com/">dribbble.com</a> and other arenas.
