      <h1>About the project</h1>

      <h2>A vision for government</h2>

      <p>
        In November 2010, Martha Lane Fox, the Government’s Digital Champion, made a review of Government’s digital services and interactions with citizens online. The subsequent report recommended a revolutionary change in Government’s digital services to a User Centred Design model, placing the user of these sites as the most important point in all considerations. As part of this, a further recommendation was made to move to a model of creation that was agile in its approach, allowing for smaller multi-disciplinary teams to work together to create user-focused solutions that could share resources and tools, built on open technology, and be found on a single domain for Government.
        You can read all of Martha Lane Fox’s report at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution
      </p>

      <h2>Where we are</h2>

      <p>Our work comes directly from the recommendations found in this report. We have created a small prototype that, in its 14 weeks of development, has tested some of the recommendations so that they can be further examined.The alpha is not intended to be an instant replacement for dozens of gov.uk sites. Neither will it improve the quality of government's online transactions. Instead, we had two objectives:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>To test, in public, a prototype of a new, single UK Government website.</li>
        <li>To design & build a UK Government website using open, agile, multi-disciplinary product development techniques and technologies, shaped by an obsession with meeting user needs.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>
        We also took the four key recommendations from Ms Lane Fox’s report and created a site around them, with a minimum viable feature set, for further scrutiny.
      </p>

      <h2>Simplicity from complexity</h2>

      <p>
        All our work has sprung from asking one question. “What are our users trying to do?” or in the more direct language of Alpha.gov.uk, “What do you want to do?”.
      </p>
      <p>
        We began an assessment of exactly what this was by looking at the search terms used to access all of government’s digital property from HMRC through to the smallest offshoot office with a subsite. The results were fascinating. The top 40 search tasks dominated 80 per cent of the traffic. The top 100 tasks were 90 per cent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We created cards to document each of these discrete tasks and these became the roadmap for our creation. How could we make each of these tasks simple to complete, so that a user need never know the internal workings of Government but still find there way to the transaction they needed to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        We devised a user-centric information architecture based on these principles:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Each visit begins from outside (ie, from a search engine) and each user is new. They know nothing about the site.</li>
        <li>Users have a task in mind that they wish to complete as quickly and simply as possible.</li>
        <li>The structure of government is largely irrelevant to their task, i.e., you do not need to know that the DVLA handles your driving license application or that the DECC (Department of Energy and Climate Change) lists fuel prices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This follows directly from the recommendations in Ms Lane Fox’s report.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Task completion and transactions</h2>
      <p>
        While it was not in the scope of this alpha to tackle the transactions that citizens commonly come to complete, we have aimed to create tools and launch pages that inform a user upfront what information they will need to hand to complete transactions such as time, cost and particulars such as a Government Gateway ID or passport.
      </p>
      <p>
        For other tasks and topics, we have tried to make the steps to task completion as simple as possible by streamlining information through a couple of well-chosen questions and by tying useful information to location. By asking for a user’s postcode we can then provide them with their local options for test centres, passport offices, police stations etc where they may need to complete any offline steps. There has also been an editorial role in creating simplified guides and answers to common questions, so that instead of wading through a large selection of articles on similar and related topics a user should be able to find an answer to a common question easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, ‘How much is my car tax?’ is common and simple to answer with a couple of data tables, with the option for less prominent additional information for marginal cases such as ‘My vehicle is wholly electric, how much is my car tax’. In the future this tabular data could become a tool, by entering a registration date and model, or be used by outside agencies to help users compare additional costs for similar models of cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tools and ‘working out’ behind them are shared assets. Location and search are universal to all our tools and are part of the glue that binds the site together. Once we built them, we could rely on them as part of the methodology for solving problems of providing accurate information for users throughout the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method of working with data, building reusable and sharable elements, and creating formats that suit users and their need for task completion is the first steps in government data becoming open and sharable. This will mean massive improvements to the customer relations side of government, selling the chance to do things digitally - the move is towards digital as the default for services across government - as an improvement on current paper based task completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open data also means the government can give outside agencies the chance to make life easier for users too, as set out in Ms Lane Fox’s report. For this to work well in the future, transactions need to be opened up too.
      </p>

      <h2>A new way for Government online</h2>

      <p>A small, multi-disciplinary team built this prototype using agile methods of development, based in one office and working together over the duration. Government has previously almost always contracted out any development to large ICT powerhouses but the number of companies able to handle the massive, multi-year projects are small. We took a potentially enormous project and broke it down into chunks, working with the aim of creating a sharable library of assets to tackle our identified task areas, within the timeframe given.</p>

      <p>Each week we took at least one new task and created the path to task resolution, as a ‘sprint’. Search queries became tasks that became sketched pages and prototype universal built tools. These had content drafted and a look and feel designed, with a focus on simple language and a unified style, before being tweaked while coding continued on back-end and front-end. At the end of each week, we would check that it worked how we felt it should and then would either revise any particular sore spots or move on to repeat the process.  In this way, we able to cover a lot of ground relatively quickly especially once our library of reusable assets had built up.</p>

      <p>This style of development is not new but it is radical in terms of Government. However, the difference in speed and cost is marked, as laid out in Ms Lane Fox’s report.</p>
