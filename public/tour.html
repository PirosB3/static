                    <h2>A quick introduction to Alpha.gov.uk</h2>
                    <p>Alpha.gov.uk is an exploration of the future of Government online. Our work is closely tied to Martha Lane Fox&rsquo;s report recommending a revolution, not evolution, in the way Government services are delivered online.</p>
                    <p>We have been commissioned by the Cabinet Office to create a prototype, or alpha, of what a single domain for government might look like; the first iteration of making this vision a reality. This is just the start but we hope it provides you with a taste of what Government online can be like.</p>

                    <h2>Ministers and Departments</h2>
                    <p>We have created a single brand for Government with a consistent feel between departments.</p>
                    <p>Ministerial positions have their own page, allowing interested parties such as businesses to understand what the responsibilities of each minister are and to learn more about the person in each position.</p>
                    <p>Departments each have a section that pulls together their latest activities within Government that allows them to focus on important policies, consultations and transparency.</p>

                    <h2>Autocomplete search as navigation</h2>
                    <p>With the breadth of Government digital services, horizontal navigation across them would be clumsy.</p>
                    <p>We believe users will search, complete a task and then leave. Our site search is designed to help users navigate and find the content they require. Equally, we expect people to use external search extensively to directly access government services.</p>

                  <div class="panel" id="4">
                    <h2>Your location</h2>
                    <p>By using simple postcode location or location by country, we are able to offer information that is local to a user - nearest post offices, passport offices or police stations for example.</p>

                    <h2>Public tools</h2>
                    <p>We have created a range of tools that tackle some of the search queries that make up a large volume of traffic to Government digital services.</p>
                    <p>These are by no means exhaustive but give a flavour of what can be created by bringing together data and location to give an individual the information they need to complete their task. We have tried to set expectations of time, cost and steps required each time.</p>

                  <div class="panel" id="6">
                    <h2>Guides and answers</h2>
                    <p>Government has a duty to provide clear information to citizens and businesses about the law and its implications. Some of these queries have a simple answer, such as a short table of Stamp Duty Land Tax rates.</p>
                    <p>Some search queries have a broader range of tasks and information associated with them. To tackle these we have created guides to topics such as redundancy, various benefits available and exporting outside the EU, complete with statutory definitions and a linked glossary to keep the content in each section streamlined. These have been edited from existing published material.</p>
