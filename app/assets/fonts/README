Fonts
=====

Here are some specifics and pecularities of the webfont solution we're using:

1. To avoid a flash of "waiting for fonts", we added Google's font
   loader [1]. This allows us to lazy-load the fonts using classes on
   the body.

2. This causes additional flashes in newer browsers as the font
   loaded, because they'd render in Helvetica and then switch to
   Transport as it was loaded. To solve this we now base64 encode the
   fonts and serve them inline in the CSS file as data-URIs.

3. This base64 encoding doesn't work in IE8 because it doesn't support
   data-URIs over 32KB in length (the OTF is currently 39KB).

4. Font rendering in IE8/XP is jagged because of cleartype. The way to
   fix this is apparently to remove some hinting from the file (TODO).
